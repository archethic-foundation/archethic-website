                            provision of services available on the DAN. The DAN consists of computer programs subject
                            only to the law of its source code, which is freely available for consultation before use
                            and developed by and for the community.</p>
                        <p class="op-08">For a proper understanding and application of the legal framework, these terms
                            of use must be accepted before any use of the services provided by the DAN. It is reminded
                            that any computer system may contain security flaws or programming errors that could lead to
                            the loss of assets involved. Similarly, it is reminded that proper use of the services
                            remains solely the responsibility of the user. Thus, no legislation or legal entity can be
                            held accountable for an error during the use of the services provided by the DAN. Finally,
                            it is reminded that any cryptographic system relies on the necessity to keep one's
                            cryptographic private key secret and that the services used cannot be blamed if it is
                            disclosed.</p>

                        <p class="op-08">In the case of decentralized financial services (DeFi), the source code and
                            smart contracts are the only participants in the various procedures. For example, in the
                            case of "bridges" made available (cryptocurrency gateways from one blockchain to another),
                            the mechanism used relies on the Atomic Swap method, in which the user remains the sole
                            master of operations, and in which there are no other stakeholders than the user himself
                            equipped with his private key and the blockchains involved.</p>
                        <p class="op-08">The terms of use herein explain the terms and conditions under which you can
                            access and use the decentralized finance services ("DeFi Services", "DeFi Products")
                            provided by the autonomous and decentralized network of the Archethic Public Blockchain. The
                            Services should include, but are not limited to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>(a) aeBridge: a user interface for bi-directional transfer of digital assets between
                                EVM-compatible or non-compatible blockchains and the Archethic Public Blockchain;</li>
                            <li>(b) aeSwap or DEX: a user interface for decentralized exchanges hosted on the Archethic
                                Public Blockchain itself and on the wallet ("Archethic Wallet" or "aeWallet");</li>
                            <li>(c) Archethic Wallet or aeWallet: The native Archethic wallet management software
                                ("Archethic Wallet", "aeWallet") for managing cryptocurrency assets (available on
                                Mobile, Windows, Linux, Mac, and Google Chrome).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="text-lg">3. Special Cases of Liquidity Pools</h3>
                        <p class="op-08">Liquidity Pools are a subset of decentralized finance (DeFi) services,
                            particularly the DEX (decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform), where exchanges can
                            only be made through liquidity pools. Anyone is free to provide liquidity between two
                            cryptocurrencies of their choice, for example: UCO and ETH or ETH and BTC, etc.</p>
                        <p class="op-08">The Archethic DEX thus differentiates between two types of liquidity pools:
                            those whose tokens or counterparties have been verified by the Archethic DAO as a reliable
                            project (notified by an icon verified), and those that have not been verified and for which
                            you take full responsibility to perform all necessary checks before use.</p>
                        <p class="op-08">Also, even in the case of pools verified by the Archethic DAO, and as
                            previously mentioned, any computer system may contain security flaws or programming errors
                            that could lead to the loss of assets involved, hence no one can be held liable in case of
                            loss or blocking of assets.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-lg">4. Non-Exhaustive List of Services of the Archethic Public Blockchain</h3>

                        <h4 class="text-md">4.1 aeBridge/aeSwap</h4>
                        <p class="op-08">The Interface provides a computer means to decentralized protocols on the
                            Archethic public blockchain that allows users to transfer digital assets between blockchains
                            (the "aeBridge protocol") or to exchange certain compatible digital assets (the "aeSwap
                            protocol").</p>
                        <p class="op-08">The interface is distinct from the protocol and is one of the means, but not
                            exclusive, to access the protocol. Each protocol includes open source or available source
                            self-executing smart contracts that are deployed on the Archethic public blockchain.</p>
                        <p class="op-08"><strong>THE DEFI PROTOCOL IS PROVIDED "AS IS", AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND WITHOUT
                                ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.</strong></p>
                        <p class="op-08">No developer or entity involved in the creation of the DeFi protocol will be
                            liable for any claim or damage associated with your use, inability to use, or your
                            interaction with other users of the DeFi protocol, including any direct, indirect,
                            incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, or loss of profits,
                            cryptocurrencies, tokens, or any other value.</p>
                        <p class="op-08">The aeBridge protocol has been deployed on EVM-compatible and Archethic
                            blockchains, while the aeSwap protocol is exclusive to the Archethic Public Blockchain.
                            Please note that digital assets from EVM blockchains that have been "bridged" or "wrapped"
                            to function on the blockchain are distinct from the original main network EVM asset.</p>
                        <p class="op-08">In the case of aeBridge, to access the Interface, you must use non-custodial
                            wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains (an EVM-compatible
                            wallet and an Archethic-compatible wallet). Your relationship with these non-custodial
                            wallet providers is governed by the applicable service terms.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-md">4.2 The Archethic Wallet</h4>
                        <p class="op-08">The Archethic Wallet allows storing digital assets; displaying addresses and
                            information that are part of the digital asset networks and broadcast transactions; signing
                            Bridge or DEX transactions; and executing any additional service available on the Archethic
                            Public Blockchain. Aside from the user himself, no entity backs up or controls the content
                            of your wallet so no one can be able to recover or transfer its content. You can consult the
                            information and conditions available at: <a href="https://www.archethic.net/wallet/">https://www.archethic.net/wallet/</a>.</p>
