                        <p class=""><em>The Archethic Public Blockchain is a universally autonomous intangible common
                                good, consisting of a network of decentralized and autonomous computers (Decentralized
                                Autonomous Network, DAN) and a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) composed of

                        <h4 class="text-lg">Data We Collect</h4>
                        <p class="op-08">Privacy is at the heart of everything we do with the Archethic Blockchain, and
                            transparency is among its values. Consequently, we strive to be transparent about the
                            minimal data we collect. We do not manage user accounts and do not collect or store personal
                            data such as your name or Internet Protocol (IP) address. When you interact with the
                            Services, we only collect:</p>

                        <h4>Publicly Accessible Blockchain Data:</h4>
                        <p class="op-08">Before using a public blockchain, be aware that all your transactions will be
                            publicly accessible. The principle of Blockchains is to prove the existence of your holdings
                            through the history of your previous public transactions. Thus, while no public data allows
                            for personal identification (pseudonymity), anyone you exchange assets with will have public
                            access to your history. You can, however, create as many Wallets as necessary to avoid any
                            cross-referencing.</p>

                        <h4>Local Information and Other Tracking Technologies:</h4>
                        <p class="op-08">Most services use cookies, beacons, and other similar technologies to provide
                            personalized navigation and optimize service performance, none of these data is retrieved or
                            processed individually. Information collected (logs, etc.) from these technologies may
                            include details such as browser type, referring/exiting pages, operating system, device or
                            browser language, and other device information. These collective data may be processed to
                            improve the user experience of the products.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-lg">Case of Services Requiring Centralization</h3>
                        <p class="op-08">For services that necessarily require centralization (non-limiting examples:
                            Wallet, Stores, cloud hosting, etc.) and therefore depend on the privacy policies of various
                            providers (Apple App Store, Google Play, Microsoft Store for example), data remains
                            collected according to your instructions, but as required by law, these data may be used for
                            the following purposes:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li><strong>Safety and Security:</strong> To protect, investigate, and deter fraudulent,
                                unauthorized, or illegal activities or to manage security risks, solve potential
                                security issues such as bugs, enforce our agreements, and protect our users and
                                associated companies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with applicable laws and regulations at the
                                request of regulators, government entities, and law enforcement, as well as in
                                litigation, regulatory proceedings, compliance measures, and when compelled by a court
